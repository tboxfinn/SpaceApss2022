  itemDescription: Makes it possible to view the dimmer objects nearby - just like
    shielding the sun from your eyes with an upraised hand can allow you to focus
    on the view in front of you, it detects lights from the earliest stars and galaxies
    in the process of formation, the population of stars in nearby galaxies, as well
    as young stars in the Milky Way and Kuiper Belt objects!
